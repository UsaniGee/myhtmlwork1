        Web developers are the architects and builders of the internet (World Wide Web). They are skilled professionals who create websites and web applications that you see and use every day. In simple terms, they write code to bring web designs to life, making sure everything works smoothly and looks good on your screen. They might work on the visible parts that you interact with (front-end development) or the behind-the-scenes logic and databases (back-end development), or even both (full-stack development). Essentially, we are the ones who make the web work!
