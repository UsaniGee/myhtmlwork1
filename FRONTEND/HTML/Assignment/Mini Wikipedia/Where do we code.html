    <p> 
         We can write our code using a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) on your computer.
    </p> 
    <p> 
        While a text editor gives us basic features like syntax highlighting and text formatting, they lack more advanced development tools. Example of which are Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or Sublime Text.

        >While IDEs are specialized software platforms designed for software development. They typically include features like code editing, syntax highlighting, debugging tools, version control integration, and project management capabilities
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course we would be using a popular IDE called Visual Studio Code but you are free to use any other popular option
