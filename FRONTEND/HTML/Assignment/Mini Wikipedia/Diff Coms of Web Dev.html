        Web development involves several key components, each playing a crucial role in creating functional and visually appealing websites and web applications. Here are the main components:

    <section>
        <!-- Frontend -->
        <p>1. Frontend Development</p>
        <p>This refers to the process of creating the visual and interactive elements of a website or web application that users directly interact with in their web browsers. It involves using languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the user interface and functionality of web pages. Below is a brief explanation about these languages
        </p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): Defines the structure and content of web pages.
            </li>
            <li>
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): Styles the layout appearance, and presentation of HTML elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                JavaScript: Adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages, such as animations, form validation, and interactive features
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <!-- Backend -->
        <p>2. Backend Development</p>
        <p>
            Backend development refers to the process of creating the server-side logic and infrastructure of a website or web application. While frontend development focuses on what users see and interact with in their web browsers, backend development handles the behind-the-scenes functionality that powers the frontend and manages data. Backend developers use programming languages such as Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, and Javascript to write the code that runs on the server. In this course we are going to use Javascript as our backend programming language. The code we are going to write would handles tasks like processing requests from the client, interacting with databases, and generating dynamic content to be sent back to the client
