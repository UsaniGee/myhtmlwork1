        <span><b>Definition of Programming: </b></span>
        <span>
            In its simplest terms, programming is the act of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a programming language, which the computer can understand and execute. Think of it like writing a recipe for a computer: you provide step-by-step instructions on what actions to take, and the computer follows those instructions to accomplish the desired outcome.

        <span> 
            is a formal set of instructions or commands used to communicate with a computer. It provides a way for programmers to write code <b>(code refers to the written instructions or statements that programmers create using a programming language to tell a computer what to do)</b> that the computer can understand and execute. Programming languages have syntax rules and conventions that dictate how code is structured and written

        <span>
            Overall, programming languages <b>serve as the intermediary between human programmers and computers,</b> enabling the creation of software, applications, and systems to solve a wide range of problems and automate various tasks.
